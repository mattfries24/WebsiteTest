      Hey everyone that is reading this, I'm Matthew Fries (obviously) and this is my website for my photo classes at Ballard High School in Seattle.
      You can come here to look at my work and criticize it and stuff, I don't really care. I think some of these photos are pretty decent, and I hope you do too.
      I've been a fan of photography for a few years now, and I've been taking pictures for most of my life. I also like other forms of art, like graphic design and music.
      (music is one of my favorite things in the world, listen to the band Peach Pit)<br><br>
      You can contact me <a href="mailto:mattfries24@gmail.com?Subject=From%20your%20website">here</a>, and I probably won't answer because I never check my email.
