          I took this picture in Fremont while I was in a car. As you can see, there are some cool light streaks from me having the shutter open for like a mimute and a half.

          This picture was also taken in fremont; i set up my tripod right by the bridge and let it stay open for a bit to get the cool light streaks.

          This picture was taken in Magnolia at night. I think the exposure is like a minute or so; it could be a but brighter and i would make it brighter if i had the chance to do it again.
